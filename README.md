C++ Conversion of a Python Code Example from the Open University


## What is this program?

This program is a python program, supplied by the Open University for the teaching of python programming.
I have converted it to C++ as a console application to test my knowledge and ability of using this language.

### This program has 2 branches:
* Main
* WithFunctions

Using the "WithFunctions" will show basic header file usage and the namespace calls within the normal app.cpp file.

I will add to this program and upgrade it as my work continues and time allows.


## Requirements
You will need any text editor to view the files, but if you wish to complile or change the code included, you will need a c++ compilier.

I personally use Microsoft Visual Studio, however others are equally as good.
